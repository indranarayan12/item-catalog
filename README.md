# item-catalog
A simple restaurant menu app using RESTful web application and the Python framework Flask along with implementing third-party OAuth authentication using various HTTP methods and implementing CRUD (create, read, update and delete) operations.

## Downloading and running the project

### Git

 [download Git from git-scm.com.](http://git-scm.com/downloads) Install the version for your operating system.

### VirtualBox

VirtualBox is the software that actually runs the VM. [You can download it from virtualbox.org, here.](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads)  Install the *platform package* for your operating system.  You do not need the extension pack or the SDK. You do not need to launch VirtualBox after installing it.

### Vagrant

Vagrant is the software that configures the VM and lets you share files between your host computer and the VM's filesystem.  [You can download it from vagrantup.com.](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) Install the version for your operating system.

## Fetch the Source Code and VM Configuration

**Windows:** Use the Git Bash program (installed with Git) to get a Unix-style terminal.  
**Other systems:** Use your favorite terminal program.

From the terminal, run:

    git clone https://github.com/indranarayan12/item-catalog item-catalog


## Run the virtual machine!

Using the terminal, change directory to oauth (**cd item-catalog**), then type **vagrant up** to launch your virtual machine.


## Running the Restaurant Menu App
Once it is up and running, type **vagrant ssh**. This will log your terminal into the virtual machine, and you'll get a Linux shell prompt. When you want to log out, type **exit** at the shell prompt.  To turn the virtual machine off (without deleting anything), type **vagrant halt**. If you do this, you'll need to run **vagrant up** again before you can log into it.


Now that you have Vagrant up and running type **vagrant ssh** to log into your VM.  change to the /vagrant directory by typing **cd /vagrant**. This will take you to the shared folder between your virtual machine and host machine.

Type **ls** to ensure that you are inside the directory that contains project.py, database_setup.py, and two directories named 'templates' and 'static'

Now type **python database_setup.py** to initialize the database.

Type **python lotsofmenus.py** to populate the database with restaurants and menu items.

Type **python project.py** to run the Flask web server. In your browser visit **http://localhost:5000** to view the restaurant menu app.  You should be able to view, add, edit, and delete menu items and restaurants.

For viewing the JSON end points type the url followed by **/JSON** which displays the same information as served by HTML end points.
